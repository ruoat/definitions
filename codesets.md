# ODA codes and code systems

Standardized code sets help facilitate interoperability between diﬀerent health care systems. Code sets used in Finnish health care are maintained by the [National Institute of Health and Welfare (THL)](https://www.thl.fi/en/web/information-management-in-social-welfare-and-health-care/standardisation-of-data-and-requirements/code-service).
Also practices documented in [ISO OID-yksilöintitunnuksen käytön kansalliset periaatteet sosiaali- ja terveysalalla](http://www.julkari.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/79996/c5aa4d04-871f-42fe-843f-bb495996d77d.pdf?sequence=1) are used.

Code sets in ODA are mainly dictated by the interfaces and data structures of the used decision support system and Finnish PHR profiles. [THL - SOTE-organisaatiorekisteri](http://91.202.112.142/codeserver/pages/classification-view-page.xhtml?classificationKey=421&versionKey=501) is a registry of Finnish health care organizations and their units. It will be used when the organization of a health care professional needs to maintained in a context. [FinLOINC](http://91.202.112.142/codeserver/pages/classification-view-page.xhtml?classificationKey=273&versionKey=350) will be used for physiological measurements.
