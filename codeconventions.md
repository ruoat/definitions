# Code Conventions
## Source code format
ODA source code is developed on various platforms and editors. Therefore common formatting should be used:
- Use UNIX newlines `\n`.
- Prefer US-ASCII characters in source code. Non-ascii characters should be encoded, e.g., ä -> \u00e4.
- Use UTF-8 in code comments and other information intended for other developers.

### Eclipse settings
- UTF-8
  * (Project) > Properties > Resources > "Text file encoding: Other: UTF-8"
- Spaces
  * Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors > "Displayed tab width:4"; "Insert spaces for tabs:check"
  * Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Indentation > tab policy : Spaces only
- Allow * in imports
  * Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Organize Imports > "Number of imports needed for .* = 2"; "Number of static imports needed for .* =2"
- Keep source formatting to edited lines only
  * Window > Preferences > Java > Editor > Save Actions > Format source code: check "Format edited lines"
- Encoding Non-ascii characters:
  * AnyEdit Tools plugin: Convert > To Unicode Notation.

## Java
- Use four spaces for indentation. Tabs must not be used.
- If methods need to return empty values use `Optional` instead of nulls.
- Return empty collections instead of nulls.
- Use assertions like `this.bar = Objects.requireNonNull(bar);` to set potentially null value. Or `org.springframework.util.Assert.*`
- Do not add unnecessary `if (foo == null)` checks. Trust conventions!
- Use Java 8 streams instead of looping collections.
- Do not add unnecessary comments. Name the method well instead.
- Keep the scope as small as possible.
- Favor RuntimeExceptions instead of Checked exceptions. This removes unnecessary crap.
- Use return Collections.emptyList() instead of return new ArrayList()
- Use return Collections.singletonList(item) instead of new ArrayList().add(item)
- Prefer (immutable) public final attributes instead of Private attributes with getters.
- Unit testing of null value capturing for dto classes is not needed as long as requireNonNull is used. Trust conventions.
- Use ArrayList instead of Vector. Vector is a relic and was not originally defined for collections.
- In Java we use camelCase
- Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship has some great practices (a few should be taken with a grain of salt, though). If you don't have access to the book, have a look at the JS version.

## JUnit
- Use assertThat and hamcrest matchers instead of assertEquals
- Use `@Test(expected = SomeException.class)` instead of try-catch
- arrange test code to follow http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrangeActAssert pattern
  + NOTE: always add empty line before and after Act-section even if test does not contain Arrange or Assert section(s) (e.g. if test is expected to throw it does not need Assertions) to make clear separation with Act-section and missing sections.
  + this may not be feasible in more complex integration tests where empty lines may be needed inside sections to make tests more readable.
- unit tests should be named with \*Test-suffix (e.g. SomeClassTest.java )
- integration tests should be named with \*IT-suffix (e.g. SomeOtherClassIT.java)
- integration tests should use IntegrationTestRule (defined in oda-service-common) to cause the test to be run only if *runIntegrationTest* environment variable is set to true. E.g.
```
public class SomeIT {

    @Rule
    public IntegrationTestRule integrationTestRule = new IntegrationTestRule();

    ...
```

## Application Interfaces
- In API:s, we use PascalCase.
- We use [Netflix zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul) as an API gateway.
  At the time of writing the service registry is static, but in the future
  micro services shall register themselves to an 
  [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) server.

## Remote APIs
- Prefer RESTful JSON APIs
- Use open standards, such as https://www.hl7.org/fhir/http.html

## Spring Framework
- Use constructor injection instead of setter injection.

## JavaScript
- Use two spaces for indentation. Tabs must not be used.
- In JavaScript we use camelCase.
- JavaScript is standardised to and validated towards ES6.
- JSX-content uses double quotes. Single quotes everywhere else. (ESLint rule: jsx-quotes)
- No spaces around objects (ESLint rule: babel/object-curly-spacing)
- Use flowtype to type-check outgoing and incoming data
- Keep necessary dependencies in as few files as possible so that they can be easily swapped later if needed

## React
- https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb

## Build Tools
- In Java we use `./gradlew clean build`
- In JavaScript `yarn install`
- Others `./build.sh`

## Version control / Git & code review
- Develop in master branch
- Keep your local master up-to-date
- Amend / squash commits that add to another commit (for example, fixes)
- Push small, complete changes as often as possible
- When ready to push:
  1. Tiny one commit change?
    - Have someone review the change before pushing or push the change and have someone review the specific commit
  2. Larger than tiny or multiple commit change?
    1. Rebase all changes from master so that your commits are on top
    2. Create feature-branch that includes all your commits and push
    3. Create pull-request and share the pull request to review the change
    4. Merge to master immediately or at least within few hours

See [Release methodology](release-methodology.md)


## Misc

Master the conventions, but also keep in mind the crucial non-code aspects of software development. While bad code has sometimes contributed to project failures, in most cases the problems have run deeper.
